Installation Guide
==================

Melexis Warnings plugin is available as a package on PyPI. Once installed, it
offers direct command line invocation (no need to run python infront).
Installation is as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Python3
    pip3 install mlx.warnings

So far we are not aware of any problems with installation of the plugin, but in
case you have any please open an Issue.
